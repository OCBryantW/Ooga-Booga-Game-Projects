# 🦍 Ooga Booga - Game Project

Welcome to our group’s repository for the **Ooga Booga** game project.

In this game project I did not make it alone, but I made it with my team. This project is made using Unity 2D as its medium.

## 🎮 Game Build
To try the game, please run the `Project Game Survival Io.exe` file located inside the `/OOGA BOOGA Jadi` folder.
